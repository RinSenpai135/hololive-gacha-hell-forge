# Hololive Gacha Hell (Forge Mod)

Hololive Gacha Hell mod for Minecraft (Forge).

Did you ever wanted to have a gacha machine in Minecraft? Do you know about Hololive?

Well, if you're interested, this is the right place!

This Minecraft mod combines Gacha frustration and Hololive memes. It will require intense grinding and a lot of time.

The goal? Collecting every single coin and token, which is assigned to a Hololive member!

Note: Fellow Hololive followers may know which talents inspired me for doing this.
